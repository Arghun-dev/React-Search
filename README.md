Here, we're going to learn how search with React, So many times you will need to search live results.

For example, if user types something in the input, for example if the user search for the picture we will get live results of pictures. Also when user search we will see a loader spinner.

And more importantly, we will have pagination buttons, next and previous buttons, to navigate to different pages, **Because if the data is large, if we have huge number of data, it would not be appripriate to show them all in one go which would actually make the query slow, if we have so much of data, so let's say we only show 20 results. and then we show the next 20 results on the next page, when the user clicks on the next button, so user can navigate between pages**

### How to do that?

for this example we will use pixabay API.
